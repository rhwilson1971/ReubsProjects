                <p> Prayer Request Journal is a site dedicated to those who simply want to stretch their faith, by publicly 
                    submitting their prayer requests.  Come back whenever you like and see how God has answered
                    the prayers of other individuals.  Whether its a testimony of overcoming any addictions, 
                    receiving blessings when helping others.  Or simply encouragement in just having just one more
                    day on this earth.  Be assured, God hears all your prayers!</p>

                <p>He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely
                give us all things?  Romans 8:32</p>

                <h2>Todays Words of Encouragement</h2>
                <p>But Jesus, looked at them and said, "With men it is impossible, but not with God; 
                   for with God all things are possible.  Mark 10:26 NKJV</p>

                <h2>Friends, we must have faith!</h2>
                <p>Afterward the disciples asked Jesus privately, &quot;Why couldn't we cast out that demon?"</p>
                <p>You don't have enough faith,&quot; Jesus told them. &quot;I tell you the truth, if you had 
                    faith even as small as a mustard seed, you could say to this mountain &sbquo;Move from here
                    to there;&sbquo; and it would move.  Nothing would be impossible.&quot; Matthew 17:12,20</p>
